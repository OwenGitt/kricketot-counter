        Welcome to Kricketot Counter, this website is currently a work in
        progress with more to come! This website has been made to document both
        my web programming and design skills as well as my shiny hunts on
        pokemon. I work on this website in my free time and will slowly make it
        better and better and hope to add many new features as I improve my web
        design and programming skills.
